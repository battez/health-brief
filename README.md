# Applied Data Skills: Processing & Presenting Data
In Jan-April 2022 I took this fab "upskilling" course at University of Glasgow: 
https://psyteachr.github.io/ads-v1/index.html

* I achieved a B1 mark, which I am proud of :) 
* I submitted an answer for technical brief 2 in the Summative Assessment. 
* For my own satisfaction, I am trying technical brief 1 here. 

## Technical brief 1 - Health Data 
My post-course attempt at health assessment of ADS R course
 
This was the first option for assessment (I submitted second option, a twitter dataset). [This technical brief option](/doc/Technical Brief 2.pdf) was for health data. For consolidating learning I here attempt this assessment.
